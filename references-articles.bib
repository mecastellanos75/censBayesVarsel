@article{2007-Zhang,
	Abstract = {We investigate the variable selection problem for Cox's proportional hazards model, and propose a unified model selection and estimation procedure with desired theoretical properties and computational convenience. The new method is based on a penalized log partial likelihood with the adaptively weighted L‚ÇÅ penalty on regression coefficients, providing what we call the adaptive Lasso estimator. The method incorporates different penalties for different coefficients: unimportant variables receive larger penalties than important ones, so that important variables tend to be retained in the selection process, whereas unimportant variables are more likely to be dropped. Theoretical properties, such as consistency and rate of convergence of the estimator, are studied. We also show that, with proper choice of regularization parameters, the proposed estimator has the oracle properties. The convex optimization nature of the method leads to an efficient algorithm. Both simulated and real examples show that the method performs competitively.},

@article{Lee:2014aa,
	Abstract = {Abstract Over the past decade much statistical research has been carried out to develop models for correlated survival data; however, methods for model selection are still very limited. A stochastic search variable selection (SSVS) approach under the proportional hazards mixed-effects model (PHMM) is developed. The SSVS method has previously been applied to linear and generalized linear mixed models, and to the proportional hazards model with high dimensional data. Because the method has mainly been developed for hierarchical normal mixture distributions, it operates on the linear predictor under the Cox type models. The PHMM naturally incorporates the normal distribution via the random effects, which enables SSVS to efficiently search through the candidate variable space. The approach was evaluated through simulation, and applied to a multi-center lung cancer clinical trial data set, for which the variable selection problem was previously debated upon in the literature.},

@article{Nott:2010aa,
	Abstract = {A Bayesian approach to variable selection which is based on the expected Kullback{\^a}‚Ç¨``Leibler divergence between the full model and its projection onto a submodel has recently been suggested in the literature. For generalized linear models an extension of this idea is proposed by considering projections onto subspaces defined via some form of L 1 constraint on the parameter in the full model. This leads to Bayesian model selection approaches related to the lasso. In the posterior distribution of the projection there is positive probability that some components are exactly zero and the posterior distribution on the model space induced by the projection allows exploration of model uncertainty. Use of the approach in structured variable selection problems such as ANOVA models is also considered, where it is desired to incorporate main effects in the presence of interactions. Projections related to the non-negative garotte are able to respect the hierarchical constraints. A consistency result is given concerning the posterior distribution on the model induced by the projection, showing that for some projections related to the adaptive lasso and non-negative garotte the posterior distribution concentrates on the true model asymptotically.},

@article{KassWasserman1995,
	Abstract = {To compute a Bayes factor for testing H0: œà = œà0 in the presence of a nuisance parameter Œ≤, priors under the null and alternative hypotheses must be chosen. As in Bayesian estimation, an important problem has been to define automatic, or "reference," methods for determining priors based only on the structure of the model. In this article we apply the heuristic device of taking the amount of information in the prior on œà equal to the amount of information in a single observation. Then, after transforming Œ≤ to be "null orthogonal" to œà, we take the marginal priors on Œ≤ to be equal under the null and alternative hypotheses. Doing so, and taking the prior on œà to be Normal, we find that the log of the Bayes factor may be approximated by the Schwarz criterion with an error of order Op(n-1/2), rather than the usual error of order Op(1). This result suggests the Schwarz criterion should provide sensible approximate solutions to Bayesian testing problems, at least when the hypotheses are nested. When instead the prior on œà is elliptically Cauchy, a constant correction term must be added to the Schwarz criterion; the result then becomes a multidimensional generalization of Jeffreys's method.},

@article{BergerPericchiVarshavsky1998,
	Abstract = {In Bayesian analysis with a "minimal" data set and common noninformative priors, the (formal) marginal density of the data is surprisingly often independent of the error distribution. This results in great simplifications in certain model selection methodologies; for instance, the Intrinsic Bayes Factor for models with this property reduces simply to the Bayes factor with respect to the noninformative priors. The basic result holds for comparison of models which are invariant with respect to the same group structure. Indeed the condition reduces to a condition on the distributions of the common maximal invariant. In these situations, the marginal density of a "minimal" data set is typically available in closed form, regardless of the error distribution. This provides very useful expressions for computation of Intrinsic Bayes Factors in more general settings. The conditions for the results to hold are explored in some detail for nonnormal linear models and various transformations thereof.},

	Abstract = {The basics of the Bayesian approach to model selection are first presented,
	as well as the motivations for the Bayesian approach. We then review
	four methods of developing default Bayesian procedures that have
	undergone considerable recent development, the Conventional Prior
	approach, the Bayes Information Criterion, the Intrinsic Bayes Factor,
	and the Fractional Bayes Factor. As part of the review, these methods
	are illustrated on examples involving the normal linear model. The
	later part of the chapter focuses on comparison of the four approaches,
	and includes an extensive discussion of criteria for judging model
	selection procedures.},

	Abstract = {Standard statistical practice ignores model uncertainty. Data analysts
	typically select a model from some class of models and then proceed
	as if the selected model had generated the data. This approach ignores
	the uncertainty in model selection, leading to over-confident inferences
	and decisions that are more risky than one thinks they are. Bayesian
	model averaging (BMA) provides a coherent mechanism for accounting
	for this model uncertainty. Several methods for implementing BMA
	have recently emerged. We discuss these methods and present a number
	of examples. In these examples, BMA provides improved out-of-sample
	predictive performance. We also provide a catalogue of currently
	available BMA software.},

@article{Morenoetal1998,
	Abstract = {Improper priors typically arise in default Bayesian estimation problems.
	In the Bayesian approach to model selection or hypothesis testing,
	the main tool is the Bayes factor. When improper priors for the parameters
	appearing in the models are used, the Bayes factor is not well defined.
	The intrinsic Bayes factor introduced by Berger and Pericchi is an
	interesting method for overcoming that difficulty. That method is
	of particular interest as a means for generating proper prior distributions
	(intrinsic priors) for model comparison from the improper priors
	typically used in estimation. The goal of this article is to develop
	a limiting procedure that provides a solid justification for the
	use of Bayes factor with intrinsic priors. The procedure is formalized
	and discussed for nested and nonnested models. Illustrations and
	comparisons with other approximations to Bayes factors, such as the
	Bayesian information criterion of Schwarz and the fractional Bayes
	factor of O'Hagan are provided.},
